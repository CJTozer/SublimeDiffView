Welcome to DiffView, a Git, SVN and Bazaar diff viewer for Sublime Text 3.

Thanks for installing!


*** Quick Start Guide ***

A few hints to get you started:
- The default key to run a diff is `Alt + Shift + D`.
    - To try out DiffView, run this command from any Git or SVN managed file that has local modifications, and then leave the "diff arguments" blank (just hit `Enter`).  This will show a diff of the uncommitted changes.
- When viewing a diff, press `Enter` to jump to the selected change.  After this, if you want to go back and see more of the same diff, `Alt + D` will drop you back in to the diff view at the point where you left off.
- To cancel a diff, press `Escape` - this will take you back to the last point you were editing before DiffView was started.


*** Features ***

A quick run-down of the key features:
- Git and SVN support
- Flexible diff options (see https://github.com/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView#supported-diff-options)
- Two different diff view modes (see https://github.com/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView#view-style)
